# music-theor

> In order to better comprehend piano songs and music in general, I am building this library to force myself to abstract music theory into components I can implement with code. Otherwise, I am aware that music theory is pretty static as a whole and doesn't require a dynamic implementation. Despite my desire to practice 'good' coding habits like modularity, high cohesion, and low coupling, this codebase will most likely be repetitive.
> I don't know if anyone's keeping track but this is my second try creating a music theory library.
